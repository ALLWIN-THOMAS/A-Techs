             <p class="text-big"> The Legend is her the Z fold 3</p>
             <p class="text-small"> The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 starts at Rs. 1,49,999 in India with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.
                 <br> There's a second variant with the same amount of RAM but twice the storage (512GB) priced at Rs. 1,57,999.
                 <br> It has been launched in three colours internationally, however at the time of this review,
                <br> Samsung only has the Phantom Black option available for Indian customers.
                 <br> This is an expensive phone and there's no two ways about it. However,
                 <br> if you picked it up during the pre-booking phase,
                 <br> chances are you would have gotten some discounts and additional benefits such as Samsung Care+ with it.
                 <br> .If we look at the phone as two halves, then the upper one has the stereo speakers on the top and bottom, plus a microphone and a dual-SIM card tray on the right, while the lower panel has the rest of the microphones and the USB Type-C port (USB 3.1 Gen1).
                <br>The outer display or â€˜cover screen' on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 is more or less the same as it was on the Galaxy Z Fold 2, except that it now supports an adaptive 120Hz refresh rate. It's a 6.2-inch AMOLED panel with an HD+ resolution (2,268x832) and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus. This display is bright and vibrant, and is useful for simple tasks such as scrolling through your Twitter feed or playing casual games, but it's not ideal for typing on unless you're a skilled swipe-typer because of how narrow it is. There's a hole-punch camera on the top, which can be masked by using smartly designed wallpapers it is the best I liked.
                <br>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 comes in a barebones package. In the box, you get only a SIM eject tool and a USB Type-C cable. You'll have to use your own charger.

        Samsung hasn't skimped on the specifications of the Galaxy Z Fold 3. You get a top-tier Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 SoC plus ample RAM and storage. The phone supports a total of 16 5G bands in India. For authentication, you can use face recognition with either of the selfie cameras (internal and external) or the fingerprint sensor that's integrated into the power button. The Galaxy Z Fold 3 has a slightly smaller 4,400mAh battery than the previous model, but with the same 25W fast charging capability. You don't need to buy a Samsung-branded charger as most USB-PD chargers up to or higher than 25W should be able to fast charge the Galaxy Z Fold 3.</p>

        One of the big additions is an IPX8 rating for water resistance, which means this phone should be a lot more resilient for everyday use compared to the previous model or any other foldable,One UI 3.1.1 based on Android 11. Any app that you open on the cover screen will transition to the main display in its exact same state, be it games, media, social apps etc, the moment you unfold the phone. Games look amazing on the main display, no matter what you play. Productivity apps such as Microsoft Office and Google Sheets are much nicer to use when you have so much screen real estate. Of course, there are a bunch of Android apps that don't adapt to the large screen as well as they should, such as Slack, and some that don't work well at all, like Instagram.
